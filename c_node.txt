"The option -Wall turns on all the most commonly-used compiler warnings---it is recommended that you always use this option! There are many other warning options which will be discussed in later chapters, but -Wall is the most important. GCC will not produce any warnings unless they are enabled. Compiler warnings are an essential aid in detecting problems when programming in C and C++."
